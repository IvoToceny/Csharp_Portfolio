This is a MarketCars App

Which uses Web API, that controls data access to MSSQL using Dapper, Authentication by Azure B2C inside BlazorServer, 
Files control through Azure Blob Storage for uploading images of cars for selling, Azure SQL Database to store tables, 
procedures and data there. API is secured by Rate Limiting, Caching and Data Validation. 

This is a Demo App for my Portfolio. 

All Web API, Blazor Server, Azure B2C, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database are all published on azure and working.
